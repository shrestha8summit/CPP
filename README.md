Code of cpp project
This code is about taking name of cities and thir temperature. The input will be stored in a file name "stud.docx".
Then our file will be called, name of city(noc) and temparture(temp) will be read by program.
Now comes the process of provinding output in the screen.
The "noc" will be displayed without any calculation but the temp will be checked if it is in CELSIUS or FAHRENHEIT.
If temp is in Fahrenheit then, it will be converted to celsius.


NOTE:-
        I have made program such a way thet is the entered temp is greater than 50 then it is declared as fahrenheit.
